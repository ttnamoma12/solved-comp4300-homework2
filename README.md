 <li>Suppose you are designing a cache for a machine with 32-bit addresses. The cache is 8MB in size. Cache blocks are 4096bytes.

  <ol>

   <li>How many blocks can be held in the cache?</li>

   <li>How many bits of the address are devoted to the offset</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

<ol>

 <li>If the cache is direct-mapped, how many bits are devoted to the tag and index?</li>

 <li>If the cache is 4-way set associative, how many bits are devoted to the tag and index? How many sets are there?</li>

 <li>If the cache is fully associative, how many bits are devoted to the tag and index?</li>

 <li>Suppose you have a machine with separate I-and D-caches. The miss rate on the I-cache is 1.6%, and on the D-cache 5.4%. On an I-cache hit, the value can be read in the same cycle the data is requested. On a D-cache hit, one additional cycle is required to read the value. The miss penalty is 110 cycles for data cache, 120 for I-cache. 25% of the instructions on this RISC machine are LW or SW instructions, the only instructions that access data memory. A cycle is 1ns. What is the average memory access time?</li>

</ol>

For I-cache:

For D-cache:

Average memory access time:
